# multilingual discord-presence-bot (/w MongoDB)

<p align="center"> Add role to users and send message to log when they are playing a game <br>
(P.S. It's going to add the role with the name of the game | Example: Game -> 'VALORANT' so it's going to look after 'VALORANT' Role so set it up like that)!</p>


# Getting Started

Install the code and fill `setting.json`so your bot get's ready..

The emoji in setting is supposed to be used when user is starting or stopping to play a game!

After installing all modules just type in terminal `node niyuki.js` so your bot get's on. Make sure you enter all correct IDs and Tokens!
